# OnlyPlants
## by Leo Tanner & Patrick Putz

After starting the Apache Tomcat server in Eclipse, navigate to the [OnlyPlants Web Application](http://localhost:8080/bp2/).

## Based on the JSF - JPA sample project which has been provided to us by our lecturers

This project demonstrates how to interact with a database (CRUD) in the context of a web application.

The project uses
* [Eclipse EE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/) (or a java development environment of your choice)
* [Apache Tomcat 9](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi)
  * Download the `Core` version
  * Extract it to a folder of your choice

The following components are used - you do not need to download them
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for build and dependency management (is part of Eclipse EE)
* [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org) - as OR mapper
* [H2 database](http://www.h2database.com) - as a leighweight local database
* [Primefaces](http://www.primefaces.org) - also visit the [ShowCase](https://www.primefaces.org/showcase/) - for UI
* [JUnit](http://junit.org) - for Unit Testing

## Get started in Eclipse
